## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ajmeriunnisa/Youtube-Clone
cd Youtube-Clone


### 2. Setup backend

cd backend
npm install

Create a `.env` file in `backend` with values like:
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Run the backend:
npm start

Backend will usually run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Setup frontend

cd ../frontend
npm install

Create a `.env` (or `vite.config`) for the API base URL if needed, for example:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

Run the frontend:

Frontend will usually run on `http://localhost:5173`.

## ✅ Current Status

- Core YouTube‑style UI implemented  
- Responsive header, sidebar, filter bar, and video grid  
- Video upload with duration, views, and fixed category dropdown  
- Channel profile image displayed on channel page and video cards  
- Comments + likes/dislikes wired to backend

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- When a user logs in, a JWT token is stored on the client and sent with protected API requests.  
- Creating a channel stores `name`, `description`, `bannerImage`, and `profileImage`, and links the channel to the user.  
- Uploading a video:
  - Takes form data (title, description, URLs, category, duration, views) from the React form.
  - Backend saves a `Video` document with `channelId`, `channelName`, and `channelProfileImage` for quick display.  
- Home page uses a custom React hook to fetch videos, filtering by selected category and search text.  
- Comments, likes, and dislikes are stored on each video document and exposed through REST endpoints.
